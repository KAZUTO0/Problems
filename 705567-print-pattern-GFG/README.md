# [Print Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-pattern3549/1)
## Easy
Given a number n, print a sequence of numbers starting from n. Each next number in the sequence is n - 5, and this continues recursively until the number becomes less than or equal to 0. After that, print the sequence in reverse order, adding 5 each time, until it reaches back to the original number n.Note: You must not use loops.
Examples:
Input: n = -16
Output: [-16]
Explanation: Since -16 is less than zero so it will remain same.
Input: n = 10
Output: [10, 5, 0, 5, 10]
Explanation: The value decreases until it is greater or equal to 0. After that it increases and stops when it becomes 10 again.
Constraints:-105 ≤ n ≤ 105
